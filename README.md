# Algortihms Runner
A program written in java that sorts multiple arrays by 6 different algorithms and prints running time of each algorithms

## The algorithms implemented:
1) Heap Sort O(nlogn)
2) Merge Sort O(nlogn)
3) Quick Sort  O(n^2) in the worst case and O(nlogn) on average
4) Selection Sort O(n^2)
5) Bubble Sort O(n^2)
6) Insertion Sort O(n^2)
